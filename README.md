# Study Javascript

Enough people have asked me "How did you learn Javascript" to warrant this document. Now when people ask me, I'll just send them this link instead of digging through my Chrome bookmarks and slacking out a list of links.

Note that everything on this list is free, but if you like what you learned, consider donating (in the case of open source projects) or buying premium memberships (in the case of products).

## Foundations

If you have no experience with any kind of web technologies, start working your way through one or both of these turoials before you try to dive into learning Javascript.

## Beginner

If you have some background in HTML and CSS, but you've never written a line of Javascript, start with [Codecademy's Intro to Javascript Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript). This is for absolute beginners. After completing the course, you could also do their [Intro to jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-jquery), but I wouldn't recommend going any deeper into jQuery than that. My personal opinion about jQuery is that, if you study Javascript regularly, you can pick up jQuery at any time, like, really, in an afternoon. But that's only after sticking with vanilla Javascript for a while.

## Beginner - Intermediate

If you have even a little bit of Javascript under your belt, you've made it to my favorite part of this list. Hands-down, the very best, most spectacular and amazing resource available on the internet today for learning Javascript is Gordon Zhu's [Watch and Code - Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript). Even if you feel like you are more of an intermediate level, you should do this course because Gordon teaching some fundamental web development skills that go beyond Javascript. It will take you two or three days. If you are more of a beginner, it will take much longer, but you will learn SOOOOOO much.

You should also do yourself and everyone else a favor and read Gordon's article on [How to Ask Good Questions](https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603). This is the ultimate meta/soft-skill that will level up your game, like, 1,000%.

After completing Practical Javascript, goto [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and do the basic, intermediate, and advanced algorithm scripting challenges. Do one or two a day, and find something else to do in between, like a project or something else to study. This the only quality material available on Free Code Camp. Don't spend time on any of the other content: its mostly low-quality. 

## Intermediate - Advanced

There are a TON of resources out there for every level of learning, but there are two resources that I consider to be the Javascript developer's bibles:

  * [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  * [Kyle Simposon's You Don't Know Javascript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
  
I probably should have mentioned Mozilla earlier in this guide, because it is the most important reference manual. It should always be open in one of your browser tabs, and you should always refer to it to understand the details of the code you're writting, methods you are calling, operators you are using, values you are manipulating, etc.

As for You Dont Know Javascript, it is just the most well-written, most in-depth look into the inner workings of Javascript. If Javascript were a human being, this would be the essential anatomy textbook that all medical students would have to read to really understand the human body. That's the best metaphor I could find. There is A LOT of information, and you shouldn't expect to understand more than 20% or 30% the first time you read it, but the idea is just to continually read it again and again as your career progresses. You will never not learn something from reading this book again.

## Bonus

The last thing I will say is that in addition to all this, you should be building things all the time. Be curious about how web technologies work, try to reverse engineer them, work on open source projects with other people who are learning. Just stay engaged and stay active.

As for bonus materials, if you really liked You Don't Know Javascript and you want more, Kyle has another great book called  [Functional Light Javascript](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS). It is as well-written as YDKJS and also rewards multiple readings.

## What NOT To Do

Here are some of my highly-biased opinions:

* Don't read Eloquent Javascript. It's poorly organized and confusing. Also the format of the online version is weird. If you don't already know Javascript well, this book will probably be more confusing than heplful.

* Don't do Free Code Camp all the way through. Aside from the sections I mentioned above, Free Code Camp is a waste of time. Trust me: I did a lot of it and regret it.
